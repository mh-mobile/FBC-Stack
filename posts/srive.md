Srive solves the problem that the smartphone version of Spotify's application does not allow continuous playback of singles or album tracks by the same artist.

A Spotify playlist creation application for Spotify Premium users who frequently use Spotify while driving or in other situations where they cannot control their smartphone.

Users can create playlists of singles, all songs including albums, etc. by simply searching for an artist.
